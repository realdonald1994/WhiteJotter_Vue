This is a simple front-end and back-end separation project, mainly developed using Vue.js + SpringBoot technologies.

In addition to being used as an introductory exercise, I also hope that the project can be used as a scaffold for some common Web projects to help you simplify the process of building a website. It is called a white jotter because it starts at 0 and gradually improves over time.
